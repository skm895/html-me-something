alt="The Cassini probe flying over Saturn">
	  <p>On Friday, September 15, the Cassini probe will make it's last mission a kamakazie dive into Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini has
been sending back valuable information about Saturn and it's moons for 13 years now. During this final dive, Cassini will be 
collecting data on Saturn's rings, clouds, atmosphere, magnetic fields, and more! For more information on the subject, please follow the link below.</p>

	  <p>The fundamental fources of nature are comprised of the strong and week nuclear forces, electromagnatism, and gravity.
Experiments conducted in Hungary might prove the existence of a fifth fundamental force in our reality.It seems that the existence of the
illusive "Dark matter" has scienctist searching for new forces to explain this unknown presence in our universe. An article published by <i>Nature</i> 
shows Attila Krasznahorkay, from Hungarian Academy of Science's Institute for Nuclear Research, who was searching for "Dark photons", but found results
predicting the existence of a particle 34 times heavier than an electron. For more information on this new theory, visit the link below.</p>

	  <p>Can bacteria communicate just like you and me? <i>Scientific American</i> has published an article in which researchers are supporting this claim.
 Gurol Suel, from University of California, and his team discovered that bacteria communicate through the same processes that nuerons use. Gurol and his team were 
also able to track these same signals leaving specific groups of bacteria, and picked up by different species of bacteria. Communities of bacteria communicating to eachother.

	  <p>The U.S. Army Research Laboratory has found a use for our pee! Researchers were surprised to find that when they combined a nano-particle
,that is based on aluminum, with urine, a great deal of hydrogen was released.
 The rate of hydrogen being released was much greater than when the experiment was conducted with only water. 
The army is now looking into future uses for this power source that could help soldiers on the ground. To read more on how our pee could be used
as a power source, follow the link below. </p>

	  <p><i>Science Daily</i> published an article on a paper by Professor Stephen Quake, from Stanford Bio-X,
who had gathered non-human DNA from a human gut. The research showed that 99 percent of the collected
DNA fragments failed to match anything known. Looks like we know very little about the hidden world within us!
